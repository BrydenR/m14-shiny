# Exercise-1
<<<<<<< HEAD
In this exercise, you'll practice loading functions from multiple files.

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository, follow the instructions in the `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to GitHub.
=======

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine.

Then, in the space below, put your favorite quote in a block quote, and provide a link to a website that provides additional information about the quote. When you push your changes back up to GitHub, you will see the rendered markdown file.

See `complete` branch for an example.
