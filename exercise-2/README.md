As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository, follow the instructions in the `ui.R` and `server.R` files, then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to GitHub.

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine.

In the space below, make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in **bold**), course title (in _italics_), and instructor.

See `complete` branch for answers.
